      <h2 class="ss-subhead">Florida Swim School teaches the
      life-saving skill of swimming in a safe environment with a nurturing method
      that builds self-confidence.</h2>
      <p>Our philosophy is that a child can never be too safe in the water, so we do not encourage a day when children should not be enrolled in swimming classes. Swimming skills must be practiced regularly in order to be effective. Children's physiological development is constantly progressing.  Therefore, the skills they are capable of achieving grow along with them.</p>
      <p>We offer swimming for all ages and abilities, beginning at 3 months.
      Our goal is that the students keep swimming as their skills become stronger to ensure their safety and to develop a love for water.</p>
      <p>Learning to swim is a necessity, not a luxury!</p>

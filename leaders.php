      <h1>Cate &amp; Kara</h1>

      <p>Cate Schlembach began her swimming career as a C-Serpent at age 6 in Ocean City New Jersey.   In 1988, her love of swimming continued when she became a lifeguard and swim teacher.  When Cate attended Villanova University she taught swim lessons at the local YMCA.  In 1993, Cate became the Aquatics Director for Tilton Athletic Club in Atlantic County, New Jersey.  Her knowledge of swimming sent her to pursue a more active role to reduce the drowning statistics in South Florida and she became the Aquatics Director at The Polo Club in 1995.</p>

      <p>In 2004, an opportunity took Cate back to South Jersey where she created Miss Cate’s Swim School using the indoor pool in her home.  During this time, Cate and Kara’s mutual passion for teaching swimming introduced them to one another.   Although their lives led them to different areas swimming in their communities, Cate and Kara were reunited in South Florida, and they are now business partners at Florida Swim School. Cate and her husband Kris have two boys, Gavin and Logan, who share the same passion for the water, spending free time surfing together.</p>

      <p>Kara Keenan Cassidy is a swimmer by marriage and completed her first swim race in 1999 - a one-mile ocean swim in South Jersey. Kara served in many administrative and coaching roles for nearly two decades of involvement with the swimming community in both New Jersey and Florida.</p>

      <p>In 1999 Kara founded the Seacats Swim School in New Jersey and has taught thousands of people of all ages how to swim and be safer in the water. In 2005, Kara was recognized by the Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce as “Top 40 Under 40” in Southern New Jersey for making a positive influence in the community.
      In 2005, Kara founded and is currently Director of Florida Swim School in Boca Raton, formerly Saint Andrew’s Swim School, which is nationally recognized as a premier learn-to-swim program for all ages.  Also in 2005, Kara and her husband began and currently own Saint Andrew’s Aquatics, which includes USA Swimming and USA Water Polo teams.
      Kara and Sid have two children: son Quinn is studying at University of Florida where he also continues his swimming career as a scholarship athlete; daughter Kate competes in water polo at Saint Andrew’s School (’17).</p>

      <p>Cate and Kara have joined forces in their passion to teach swimming to all ages, from 3 months to adult.  Their teaching relationship began at the Jersey Shore of Ocean City and continues to beautiful Boca Raton, Florida and surrounding communities.  Florida Swim School will be opening a second location indoors in Boca Raton&hellip; stay tuned!</p>

      <p>Summer is in full swing at Florida Swim School! Our beautiful indoor facility is open and the pool is busy! Aqua-Kids Summer Camp includes lots of instruction in the pool, plus pool games, arts and crafts, and movie time. No sunscreen is needed! We will continue to host Aqua-Kids Summer Camp all summer, as demand requires it.</p>
      <p>Weather will no longer interfere and cancel our swim classes! </p>
      <p>Baby &amp; Me Classes are quite popular and we are proud to have adults also taking classes. Itâ€™s never too late to learn to swim! </p>
      <p>As you know, summer is the time for pool parties! Have your pool party indoors at Florida Swim School! No need to schedule a &quot;Rain Date&quot; anymore! </p>
      <p>As always, refer a friend and receive a $25 credit! </p>
      <p>We look forward to seeing you at our new location&hellip; keep swimming!</p>

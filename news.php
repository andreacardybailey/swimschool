      <p>August is here already!</p>

      <p>The staff at Florida Swim School hopes that your family has been enjoying a safe summer!  We have many new swimmers and want to remind all of you that it is important to keep practicing swimming after summer ends.</p>

      <p>All of the skills you and your children have learned should be practiced in regular swimming classes to be safer in the water!  History shows that when students stop swim classes for months at a time, their skills are forgotten&hellip;</p>

      <p>August is our first give-away!  All swimming students who are enrolled in swim classes and Aqua-Kids Summer Camp in August will receive a Florida Swim School cinch bag!  We will post a picture of the bags on  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swimclassesflorida" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>.</p>

      <p>Aqua-Kids Summer Camp will continue through August 14.  If there is enough requests, we will also add the week of August 17, so please call Florida Swim School if you are interested!</p>

      <p><strong>Learning to swim is a necessity, not a luxury!</strong></p>

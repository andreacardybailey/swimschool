<p>Cate and I attended the United States Swim School Association
national conference last week. It was an honor for me to be a presenter
and share Florida Swim School philosophies. In addition, we learned new
ideas and look forward to implementing them! Thank you for your patience
and understanding with our limited staff while we were gone.</p>
<p>See you at the pool,</p>

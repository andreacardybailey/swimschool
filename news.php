<p>We have had parents ask about taking time off from swim classes.  It is important 

to understand that learning to swim is a process for the child and a commitment 

for the parents.</p>

<p>It is normal for children’s skills to plateau.  Although it seems they may not be 

learning anything new, they are perfecting the skills they are able to do based on 

their individual coordination and comfort.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it takes almost 6 months to learn to crawl and one year to walk, 

practicing every day!  Our goal is for the children to be safe as they enjoy the 

water.  Keep in mind that when your child takes time off swimming, skills may be 

lost.  While schedules are changing and lives get hectic, it is important for 

something to remain constant…swimming!  Our schedules are flexible to 

accommodate your busy days.</p>

<p><strong>Learning to swim is a necessity, not a luxury.</strong></p>

      <p>Florida Swim School is happy to see the swimmers improving their skills in the pool!  Spring is around the corner so be sure to tell your friends to schedule their classes now.  Florida Swim School offers $20 credit for every referral!</p>
      <p>Swimming in Boca Raton is usually very warm.  The past two weeks Florida Swim School was forced to cancel some classes due to very cold weather.  We have not figured out how to control the weather, but we will honor those cancelled classes with make-ups, so please contact us to schedule.  </p>
      <p>The indoor facility of Florida Swim School in Boca Raton is making progress.  There have been some hurdles and delays, but we will be open soon! At this point we will not offer a date and we will keep you posted.</p>
      <p>Florida Swim School does not keep the same schedule as the public or private academic schools.  When there is a school holiday, Florida Swim School is still operating the regular schedule.  <strong><u>During school spring break, Florida Swim School will have classes at the regular times.</u></strong> Teachers are scheduled accordingly, so please let us know any time you will miss class.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>January 1 &ndash; New Year's Day</li>

      <p>Finally winter is over in Boca Raton! That was a cold two weeks! Now we can get our swimming schedules in place at Florida Swim School so our children can practice their swimming skills and learn new ones before summer! Keep in mind that repetition is how children learn best. After all, it takes approximately 6 months for them to learn to crawl and they practice that all day every day! It takes a year and sometimes more for children to learn to walk practicing every day for several hours&hellip; Swimming is different since the children are in a new environment (water), with limited senses, so learning the life-saving skill of swimming takes commitment. Florida Swim School is dedicated to teaching swimming and we thank our families for trusting us with their precious children.</p>
      <p>Florida Swim School is getting closer to opening their indoor facility! Once we have a tentative date, we will post it. Please check our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swimclassesflorida" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> for updates and pictures. There will be swim classes at both locations.</p>
      <p>We will have <strong><em>indoor</em></strong> Splash Camp this summer and registration will be open next week. We will have Splash Camp the weeks of June 8, June 15, August 3, August 10. We may add weeks depending on popularity. Hours will be from 9am-3pm and the camp is for ages 4-11. Early drop-off and late pick up will be available. We will provide a typical day and pricing on our website by March 12.</p>
      <p>Swim classes will continue with the same schedule through all spring breaks. If your child will not be attending, be sure to contact us in advance in order to secure a make-up class.</p>
